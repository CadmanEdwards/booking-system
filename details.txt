Current milestones
---------------------------------
So requirements now:
1. I want to send an email with attachment to a adress like (factuur@praktijk-afspraken.nl) and it will be saved in incoming invoice (like we made). Laravel updating
2. Save button only saving (fixed)
3. Make new booking in booking detail (making new button where that client is already filled in
4 deleted bookings/ invoice in deleted items (I can permanently delete that box)
5. Flexibility for invoice creating (side text invoice/ logoâ€™s change)	


	Instruction
	-----------
		Nr1. is for incoming invoice. 
		So when I send an email to an adress. (Maybe facturen@praktijk-afspraken.nl) than the attachment will be. 
		Automatically saved in incoming invoices

		So let say you send me an invoice for make this system than you will send it to
		Facturen@praktijk-afspraken.nl

		Than the attachment (the invoice) will be saved thered


		I have to pay like:
		- rent
		- internet 
		- hosting service

		They will sent every month an email with there invoices. I wil give them an e-mail adres where they can sent it to (facturen@praktijk-afspraken.nl)

		Then it will upload it automatically to praktijk-afspraken incoming invoices
